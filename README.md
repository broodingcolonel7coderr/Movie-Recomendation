# Movie-Recomendation

This project aims to recommend movies similar to the movie that has been inputted by the user, as in Netflix platform where we get similar suggestions after watching a particular movie, 

In order to check similarity Ive used the concept of cosine similarity that is present inside the module sklearn in python

Later ive sorted the array in descending order so that the most similar movies r displayed
